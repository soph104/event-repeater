---Deprecated since Discord now includes this feature natively---

Simple discord bot to repeat events, based on the official discord tutorial so some stuff from that is still in there.

Whenever an event is started, the bot checks if the description includes the word "repeater." If it does, the bot creates an identical event one week later.
To use just put "repeater" somewhere in the event description and make sure to actually start the event.
